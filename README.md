- **Career Comparison Tool:** Allow users to select two recommended careers and receive a detailed, AI-generated comparison of day-to-day responsibilities, salary expectations in India, and long-term growth prospects.
 
- **Hyper-Localized Learning:** Enhance the learning path suggestions to include resources from Indian educational initiatives (like NPTEL) and tutorials available in regional languages.

- **User Feedback Loop:** Allow users to rate their recommendations, providing valuable data to further fine-tune the AI prompts and improve results over time.
